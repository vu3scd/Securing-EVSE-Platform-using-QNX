# Quantum-Secure EVSE Architecture: A QNX-Based Security Whitepaper

This repository hosts the technical whitepaper titled:

**“Securing EV Charging Infrastructure: A QNX-Based Approach for High-Assurance Systems”**

## 📄 About the Whitepaper

As electric vehicle adoption accelerates and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) ecosystems mature, the cybersecurity of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) has become critical. Most charging stations today run on general-purpose Linux, exposing a wide attack surface.

This whitepaper proposes an alternative: a high-assurance architecture based on the **QNX Neutrino RTOS**, designed for safety-critical environments and enhanced with **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**.

It includes:

- Threat mapping across OCPP 2.1, ISO 15118-20, and grid/cloud interfaces  
- QNX microkernel architecture for EVSE security  
- Integration of Kyber/Dilithium-based hybrid cryptography  
- Compliance alignment with **IEC 62443**, **EU AFIR**, and **ISO 21434**  
- OTA, secure boot, HSM/TPM design, and runtime integrity checks

> 🔐 **Status:** Architectural concept. Not yet field-tested or certified.
